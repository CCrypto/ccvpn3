Title: Install on Android

1. First, you have to install [Arne Schwabe's OpenVPN for Android][openvpn_android].
    It is the most frequently updated and secure OpenVPN client for Android.

2. Download the .ovpn file you need in [your account](/account/config) and save it
    somewhere on your Android device.

3. Open the OpenVPN for Android application and import the .ovpn file.  
    It will create a new profile from the configuration file.  

4. *(Optionally)* Edit the imported profile and set your username and password if you do not
    want to be asked every time.

5. You can now connect to that profile.
    On connection it will show the log while trying to connect.  
    If it fails to connect, you can use the menu here to send the log by email
    to *support at ccrypto.org* or copy it in a support ticket.
